Update: The project is suspended, as it turns out there is no sense to extend firmware from Asus, because there are much better firmwares out there. Check this out: http://www.shcherbyna.com/?p=802

The main idea of this project is to extend the original firmware of RT-N16 router written by Asus to explore it's power!

This project has no relation to openwrt, ddwrt or oleg's firmware. The intention for this project is to extend the original Asus firmware with useful tools which will make fun of using your router.

The wiki contains articles which cover simple topics specially useful for newbies, i.e., how to enable telnet in router, how to extend it with flash drive, etc.
